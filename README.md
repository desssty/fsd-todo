# FSD Todo List

**FSD Todo List** is a learning project built using the **Feature-Sliced Design (FSD)** architecture approach. It demonstrates a modular and scalable structure for frontend applications using **React**, **MobX**, and **TypeScript**.

## üöÄ Technologies

- [React 19](https://react.dev/)
- [MobX](https://mobx.js.org/)
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React Router v7](https://reactrouter.com/en/main)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

## üì¶ Project Structure (FSD)

The project follows the **Feature-Sliced Design** methodology, which organizes code by purpose and responsibility:

- `app/` ‚Äì App initialization and root-level configuration
- `pages/` ‚Äì Application pages
- `features/` ‚Äì Business logic units (tasks, etc.)
- `entities/` ‚Äì Core domain entities and models
- `shared/` ‚Äì Shared resources (UI components, utilities, API, etc.)

## ‚öôÔ∏è Available Scripts

```bash
# Start development server
npm run dev
```
